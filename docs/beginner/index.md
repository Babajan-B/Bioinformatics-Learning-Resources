## Learning Tips

!!! tip "Study Strategies"
    - **Practice daily** - Even 30 minutes makes a difference
    - **Type, don't copy** - Write code yourself to learn
    - **Use real data** - Download sample datasets and experiment
    - **Join communities** - Ask questions on [Biostars](https://www.biostars.org/)

!!! warning "Common Pitfalls"
    - Don't skip the command line - it's essential
    - Don't rush through programming basics
    - Don't try to learn everything at once - focus on one topic
